        Camera's are my favorite! I think Canon cameras are the
        best because of their focus on video quality. Canon was
        created August 10, 1937. That means about 85 years
        mastering camera quality. They were created in Tokyo,
        Japan but are widely used around the U.S. and at major
        production agencies, including but not limited to Boulder
        Media House. Where I work!
