    <h1>Hello, Me</h1>
    <p>
        Emma primarily operates under Buffalo Film Co., BMH’s sister company that is all things weddings. As the producer and lead editor of Buffalo Film Co., Emma spends most of her time at the office chatting to couple’s who are getting married and finding new music for the latest wedding film (her favorite part of the job). She makes it her daily goal to make each couple feel special and comfortable in-front of the cameras, ensuring that each film is unique to them and their story. If she’s not filming a wedding on the weekend, you can find her most likely attending a concerts of any genre or taking photos of those artists.
